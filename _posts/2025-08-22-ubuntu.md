## Purpose

This post is a running list of things that have greatly improved my experience on Linux

____________

- `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad send-events disabled-on-external-mouse`
    - Disables the touchpad when an external mouse is connected. Isn't that NEAT?!
- Aliases
    - I am a huge proponent of using liases for everything from commonly ssh'd into machines to paths to `.AppImage` files.
